## Description 

- `AugmentedTexts4Training.ipynb`: how the texts are augmented for the later classification models training. 
- `AugmentedTextsQualityAnalysis.ipynb`: how the quality of the augmented texts is evaluated as in the Section 4.1. 
- `CodeSnippet4TrainingERNIEGram.ipynb`: Code Snippet for finetuning the ERNIE-Gram model.
- `CodeSnippet4TrainingNeuralClfModels.ipynb`: Code Snippet for training the other four classification models.
- `PrecisionRecallF1.ipynb`: how the precision, recall, and f1 scores are calcualted based on the prediction results as in `tests_pred.zip`. 
- `tests_pred.zip`: the predicting results of the five classification models on the test set. For copyright concerns, the original test set texts are replaced with "-".
