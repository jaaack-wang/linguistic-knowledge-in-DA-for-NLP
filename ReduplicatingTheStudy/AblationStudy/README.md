## Description 

- `TrainSets4AblationStudy.ipynb`: how the texts are augmented using only one text editing operation for the later classification models training. 
- `Ablation-ERNIE.ipynb`: Code Snippet for finetuning the ERNIE-Gram models for the ablation study.
- `Ablation-NeuralClfModels.ipynb`: Code Snippet for training the other four classification models for the ablation study.
- `Ablation_Metrics_Plotting.ipynb`: how the precision, recall, and f1 scores are calcualted and plotted based on the prediction results as in `ablation_tests_pred.zip`. 
- `ablation_tests_pred.zip`: the predicting results of the five classification models on the test set for the ablation study. For copyright concerns, the original test set texts are replaced with "-".
