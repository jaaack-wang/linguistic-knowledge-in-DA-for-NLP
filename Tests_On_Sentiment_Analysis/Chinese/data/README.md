## Description

This folder should store the following data:

- `chnsenticorp` (`train.tsv`, `dev.tsv`, and `test.tsv`), which can be downloaded from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/duanruixue/chnsenticorp). You can also check my [text-classification-explained](https://github.com/jaaack-wang/text-classification-explained) to further learn how they can be used to train deep learning models.

- Baidu Ngrams (`BaiduKnowsUnigram.json`, `BaiduKnowsBigram.json`, `BaiduKnowsTrigram.json`, and `BaiduKnowsFourgram.json`), which is something I used for my preprint. You can have them downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IA7HfpYrB5XRUPSV69DVKl2PANU5NvpH/view?usp=sharing). You can learn how they are compiled by visiting my [ChineseNgrams repository](https://github.com/jaaack-wang/ChineseNgrams/tree/main/WordsBased).

- `synonyms_en.json`, again, was used previously for my preprint. You can learn how it was compiled and preprocessed in my [Chinese-Synonyms repository](https://github.com/jaaack-wang/Chinese-Synonyms/tree/main/Trimmed_Synonyms). 

- `aug_texts`, a foler that store the three types of train sets of 5 different sizes. You can get it by running the `AugmentedTexts4Training.ipynb` file as in the `Aug_Texts` folder. Alternatively, you can get it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1az4vXvuCK4gfiDxU6aOVtZHR43gxftdy/view?usp=sharing).
